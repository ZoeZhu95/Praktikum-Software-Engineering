# Software Engineering Project
// This file is a copy of software engineering project based on a Segway configurated with Kinect Depth Camera.

// According to given specifications, a software program should be developed to support the autonomous driving of the Segway. The autonoumous driving works mainly by searching, recognizing and following a marker, which will be hanged on a car in front of the Segway. (More detailed specifications see the file /Spezifikation/)

// The complete development progress is based on V-model, the flow of which is specification analysis - system design - system architecture - module design - implementation with code - unit test - system verification - system validation

// zip file /pse_2019_gruppe3/ contains implementations with C++ and relavant documentation with doxygen
// zip file /pse_EA / contains system design and archtecture with UML diagramms
// the file /Spezifikation/ contains the description of the target Segway system
